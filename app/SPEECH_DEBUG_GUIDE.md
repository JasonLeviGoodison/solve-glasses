# Speech Recognition Debugging Guide

## ‚úÖ Good News!

Camera is working perfectly - photos are being captured successfully! üì∏

## üêõ Issue: Speech Recognition Not Working

The speech recognition isn't starting or showing transcripts. I've added comprehensive logging to help debug this.

## What I Added

### Logging in SpeechRecognitionService

Now you'll see logs like:

```
SpeechRecognition: startListening() called
SpeechRecognition: Creating new SpeechRecognizer
SpeechRecognition: Starting speech recognition
SpeechRecognition: Ready for speech
SpeechRecognition: Beginning of speech
SpeechRecognition: Partial results: hello world
SpeechRecognition: Final results: hello world
```

Or if there are errors:

```
SpeechRecognition: Error: Insufficient permissions (code: 9)
SpeechRecognition: Error: Network error (code: 4)
```

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Run the App and Watch Logs

Run this command in terminal:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "SpeechRecognition|VuzixViewModel"
```

### Step 2: Check What Logs You See

#### Case 1: No Logs at All

**Problem:** Speech recognition is not being started
**Possible causes:**

- ViewModel not initializing properly
- startListening() not being called

#### Case 2: "Speech recognition not available"

**Problem:** Google Speech Services not installed on emulator
**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if Google app is installed
adb shell pm list packages | grep google
```

#### Case 3: "Error: Insufficient permissions (code: 9)"

**Problem:** Microphone permission not granted
**Solution:** Check permissions were actually granted

#### Case 4: "Ready for speech" but no results

**Problem:** Microphone not capturing audio on emulator
**Solution:** Emulator microphone might not be working

## Quick Test

### Test 1: Check if startListening() is called

Look for this log:

```
SpeechRecognition: startListening() called
```

If you DON'T see this, the issue is in ViewModel initialization.

### Test 2: Check for errors

Look for:

```
SpeechRecognition: Error: <error message>
```

### Test 3: Check permissions

Run:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys package com.example.cheating_glasses | grep "RECORD_AUDIO"
```

Should show:

```
android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO: granted=true
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Speech recognition not available"

**Solution:** Install Google app on emulator

```bash
# This is usually pre-installed, but if not:
# Download Google app APK and install
```

### Issue: "Insufficient permissions"

**Solution:** Verify permissions were granted

- Check the permission request dialog appeared
- Grant RECORD_AUDIO permission
- Restart the app

### Issue: No errors but no transcripts

**Solution:** Emulator microphone issue

- Emulators don't have real microphones
- Google Speech Services might not work well on emulator
- **Test on real device for speech recognition**

## Expected Behavior on Real Device (Vuzix Blade 2)

1. App starts
2. Permissions granted
3. Logs show:
   ```
   SpeechRecognition: startListening() called
   SpeechRecognition: Creating new SpeechRecognizer
   SpeechRecognition: Starting speech recognition
   SpeechRecognition: Ready for speech
   ```
4. You speak
5. Logs show:
   ```
   SpeechRecognition: Partial results: <your speech>
   ```
6. Transcript appears on screen

## Important Notes

### About Emulators

‚ö†Ô∏è **Speech recognition often doesn't work well on emulators** because:

1. No real microphone
2. Google Speech Services may not be properly configured
3. Network connectivity issues

### Recommendation

‚úÖ **Test speech recognition on actual Vuzix Blade 2 device**

- Real microphone
- Proper Google Services
- Full functionality

### Alternative: Test with Text Input

If you need to test keyword detection without speech, you could temporarily add a text input field to manually trigger the keyword detector.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the app** and check logcat for speech recognition logs
2. **Share the logs** you see (especially SpeechRecognition tags)
3. **Note any error messages**
4. If "Speech recognition not available" ‚Üí Emulator issue, test on real device
5. If "Insufficient permissions" ‚Üí Check permission grant dialog
6. If "Ready for speech" but no results ‚Üí Emulator microphone issue

## Full Log Command

To see everything:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "SpeechRecognition|VuzixViewModel|CameraManager"
```

This will show:

- Speech recognition activity
- ViewModel initialization
- Camera operations (which are working ‚úÖ)

## What to Look For

### Successful Flow:

```
VuzixViewModel: Initializing with permissions
SpeechRecognition: startListening() called
SpeechRecognition: Creating new SpeechRecognizer
SpeechRecognition: Starting speech recognition
SpeechRecognition: Ready for speech
[User speaks]
SpeechRecognition: Partial results: solve this problem
KeywordDetector: Keyword "solve" detected!
CameraManager: Capturing photo...
CameraManager: Photo capture succeeded
```

### What You Have Now:

```
CameraManager: Using front camera
CameraManager: Camera initialized successfully (ImageCapture only)
CameraManager: Photo capture succeeded ‚úÖ
[Missing speech recognition logs ‚ùå]
```

**Run the app now and share the SpeechRecognition logs you see!**
